# Restaurant Finder App

A lightweight, intuitive **Restaurant Finder App** that helps you search for restaurants by name and discover where theyâ€™re located â€” starting with those nearest to you!

Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the app uses open APIs for real-time restaurant data and geolocation services to enhance user experience.

## Features

- **Search by Name**: Enter a restaurant name and get a list of matches.
- **Location-Based Sorting**: Results are automatically sorted by proximity â€” nearest restaurants show up first.
- **Map Integration** *(optional)*: Visualize where each restaurant is located.
- **API Integration**: Fetch data dynamically using public REST APIs for both restaurants and geolocation.

## What I Learned

This project was a deep dive into:
- **Working with external APIs**: Fetching, parsing, and rendering dynamic data.
- **User location handling**: Using browser-based geolocation and integrating it with API queries.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Managing `fetch()`, Promises, and handling real-time data updates.
- **UX/UI considerations**: Designing for both performance and usability.
